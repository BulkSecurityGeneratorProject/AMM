			We will use or disclose your personal information only for the purpose for which you provide it to us.

		<p>
			You may opt out of receiving any communications from us at any time, although we may then be unable to provide you with all of the information regarding our programs, events, or services which may be of benefit to you. If you decline to provide us with your personal information (or subsequently opt-out) it will likely preclude the provision of relevant services to you by Arterial Group.
